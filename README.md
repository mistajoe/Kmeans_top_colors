# Kmeans_top_colors
I modified a code to read an image, displaying its sizes before and after resizing and adjustment. This involves creating a matrix that allocates rows to pixels, utilizing the k-means algorithm to analyze the image, and finally calculating the top dominant colors.

Considered a type of Machine learning. Unsupervised learning.

A huge thanks to machine leanring projects page.


I attached the png used in the code, if you want you can use the same one or change it to something else. But keep in mind you also have to change 
the format of the file.
